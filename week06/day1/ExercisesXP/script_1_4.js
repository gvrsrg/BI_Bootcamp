//#4
const a = 1;
function funcSix() {
    let a = "test";
    alert(`inside the funcSix function ${a}`);
}


// #4.1 - run in the console:
// funcSix()
// #4.2 What will happen if the variable is declared 
// with const instead of let ?

// My answer: Nothing will change because they have different scopes
